            <p class="headings"><em>[Verse 1]</em></p>
            <p>Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue</p>
            <p>Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession</p>
            <p>Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor</p>
            <p>Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard</p>
            <p>I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush</p>
            <p>Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough</p>
            <p>I overthink your p-punctuation use</p>
            <p>Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do</p>
            <br>
            <p class="headings"><em>[Chorus]</em></p>
            <p>A rush at the beginning</p>
            <p>I get caught up, just for a minute</p>
            <p>But lover, you're the one to blame</p>
            <p>All that you're doing</p>
            <p>Can you hear the violence?</p>
            <p>Megaphone to my chest</p>
            <p>Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom</p>
            <p>And make 'em all dance to it</p>
            <br>
            <p class="headings"><em>[Post-Chorus]</em></p>
            <p>Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom</p>
            <p>And make 'em all dance to it</p>
            <p>Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom</p>
            <p>And make 'em all dance to it</p>
            <p>Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom</p>
            <p>And make 'em all dance to it</p>
            <p>Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom</p>
            <p>And make 'em all dance to it</p>
            <br>
            <p class="headings"><em>[Verse 2]</em></p>
            <p>Our thing progresses, I call and you come through</p>
            <p>Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you</p>
            <p>But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre</p>
            <p>Down the back, but who cares? Still the Louvre</p>
            <p>Okay, I know that you are not my type (Still I fall)</p>
            <p>I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (But what about love?)</p>
            <p>Nothing wrong with it, supernatural</p>
            <p>Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting</p>
            <br>
