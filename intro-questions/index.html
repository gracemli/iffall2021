        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <p><h4><li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li></h4></p>
                <p>My name is Grace, and I'm a sophomore, planning on double majoring in Marketing and ComDes.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I'm interested in possibly pursuing UI/UX as a career, so I think a lot of the skills I'll learn in this class will relate to this subject.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I am excited to learn about these languages this semester!</p>
            <p><h4><li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I would love to learn techniques to set up websites that are both intuative to use and visually pleasing to look at.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I think designing for paper typically is more static, whereas designing for screens is usually more dynamic; it will require you to consider multiple options for paths to lead your user down, depending on what they select.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I think <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> is a website with effective design because it is easy to navigate, and it gives TV show and movie recommendations tailored to each specific user.</p> 
            <p><h4><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li></h4></p>
                <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> is a website with effective communication because it is intuitive to use and offers many modes and time estimations based on the mode of transportation you choose.</p>
            <p><h4><li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li></h4></p>
                <p>I think <a href="https://cheyennebarton.com">Cheyenne Barton's</a> shop website works well because it does a good job showcasing her art, is consistent with her branding, and is straightforward to navigate.
